# Agent Instructions & Workflow Rules for JomKahwin

## UI/UX Development Mandatory Workflow

Whenever creating, editing, or refactoring UI components or pages in this codebase, you MUST automatically apply and enforce these 8 skills:

1. **`apple-design-critic`**:
   - Ensure clean grid alignment, generous intentional whitespace, typography scale, restraint, and clear visual hierarchy.

2. **`faang-portfolio-reviewer`**:
   - Maintain senior-level craft, high signal-to-noise ratio, skimmable storytelling, strong hero contrast, and zero visual bugs.

3. **`motion-designer`**:
   - Ensure smooth 60fps micro-interactions (`100ms-350ms`), natural `cubic-bezier` easing curves, hardware-accelerated properties (`transform`, `opacity`), and `prefers-reduced-motion` compliance.

4. **`accessibility-expert`**:
   - Enforce WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA contrast ratios (min 4.5:1 text), visible `:focus-visible` rings, semantic HTML structure, and full keyboard navigation.

5. **`design-system-enforcer`**:
   - Strictly enforce design system tokens (4px/8px spacing grid, tokenized border radii, typography scale, and theme color variables). Automatically replace any arbitrary/ad-hoc values.

6. **`izwan-flagship-architect`**:
   - Strictly enforce signature flagship UI/UX style: upright static device mockups, scroll-driven chapter UI replacement, high signal-to-noise scannable copywriting, clean header separation, and theme color compliance.

7. **`zero-lag-motion-optimizer`**:
   - Guarantee 60fps/120fps hardware-accelerated performance by eliminating live CSS `filter: blur()` animations, keeping background texture grids static, enforcing static GPU radial gradients, and applying `transform-gpu` (`translateZ(0)`) compositing.

8. **`relentless-10x-doer`**:
   - Anti-laziness, anti-hallucination operating doctrine. Never shortcut, finish thoroughly with 3 passes (works → polished → proactive edge cases), verify against reality with real tool output, and stay 10 steps ahead by shipping tested, pushed code.

## Code Execution Standard
- Every UI component built must be self-audited against these 8 skills before finishing a turn.
- Always aim for premium, state-of-the-art aesthetics that wow the user at first glance while guaranteeing zero-lag performance.
